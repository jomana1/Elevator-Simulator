# Hospital Elevator Simulator
This project implements a hospital elevator simulator using C++. The simulator replicates the actions of a hospital elevator system across multiple floors and handles various user demands efficiently. The primary objectives were to enhance elevator performance and reduce passenger wait times through the development and integration of a simulation algorithm and different control strategies.

**Key Features**

- **Multiple Elevators:** Includes three distinct elevators:
  - Patient Elevator
  - Visiting Elevator
  - Cargo Elevator

- **Priority Handling:** Prioritizes patients needing urgent medical care, ensuring swift transport while balancing hospital operational needs and visitor demands.

**Simulation Algorithm**

The simulation algorithm ensures efficient passenger handling by dynamically managing elevator operations based on real-time demands and priorities. This includes optimizing elevator routes and minimizing wait times.

**Technologies Used**

- **Language:** C++
- **Skills:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures

**Project Objectives**

The main goals of this project were to:
- Improve elevator performance in a hospital setting.
- Implement effective control strategies to minimize passenger wait times.
- Gain practical experience in programming, data structures, and algorithm design.

**Usage**

To run the hospital elevator simulator:
1. Compile the C++ source files.
2. Execute the compiled program to start the simulation.

**Future Enhancements**

Future enhancements could include:
- Integration of graphical user interface (GUI) for visualization.
- Incorporation of machine learning algorithms for predictive elevator operations.
- Expansion of simulation scenarios to include more complex hospital layouts and traffic patterns.
